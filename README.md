# DEEPCRAFTâ„¢ Micropython Data Acquisition

This repository provides a framework to stream sensor data like audio from PDM microphones over WiFi using MicroPython.

## Tested Boards:

- CY8CKIT-062S2-AI

## Pre-requisites
1. PSoC6 based device flashed with MicroPython firmware. Check the [mpy-psoc6.py utility](https://ifx-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/psoc6/installation.html) to do so.

2. Clone the captureserver repo:
    
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/imagimob/captureserver/src/master/ 
    
and follow the instruction to setup.


## 2. Sensor data acquisition
1. In TCP-mpy.py script add your Wifi name and password  to use your wifi to transfer the data:
    ```bash
    SSID = "your wifi name"
    PASSWORD = "your wifi password"
    ```
2. In capture server cloned repo  move to generic folder using 
    ```bash
    cd examples/generic
    ```
3. Specific commands for each demo ,TCP :
    ```bash
    python generic_local_capture_interface.py --output-dir "mention the output dir" --protocol TCP --ip-address 192.168.0.108 --port 5000  --data-format .wav --data-type h --samples-per-packet 512 --features 1 --sample-rate 16000 --video-disabled.
    ```
The data will be stored in the output directory mentioned .

## 3. Importing to studio:

1. Now open the Deepcraft Studio .Create a new project / open a project.And click the add data button inside the DATA tab  and choose the output directory in which you saved the files .

2. you should see an audio and label file session automatically selected.

3. After successful adding you can see the data session created inside the studio.Now you can get your data inside the studio and start training the model.
